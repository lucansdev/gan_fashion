# Fashion-MNIST GAN

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The project utilizes a GAN to generate images of fashion items similar to those found in the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The GAN is composed of two neural networks:

1.  **Generator**: This network is responsible for learning the data distribution and generating new images. It takes a random noise vector as input and transforms it into a synthetic image.
2.  **Discriminator**: This network acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real images (from the Fashion-MNIST dataset) and fake images (generated by the Generator).

The two networks are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game: the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator by producing increasingly realistic images, while the Discriminator tries to become better at identifying fake images. This iterative process leads the Generator to produce high-quality images that are indistinguishable from real images.

## Dataset

The model was trained on the popular **Fashion-MNIST** dataset. This dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of 10 categories of fashion items, such as t-shirts, trousers, sneakers, etc. It is a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset and is frequently used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

## Type of GAN

This implementation uses a **traditional GAN** (also known as Vanilla GAN), which is the fundamental type of GAN architecture.

## How it Works

The training of a GAN involves the following steps:

1.  **Discriminator Training**: The Discriminator is fed a batch of real images from the dataset and a batch of fake images generated by the Generator. It is then trained to classify real images as "real" and fake images as "fake."
2.  **Generator Training**: The Generator is trained to produce images that the Discriminator classifies as "real." During this stage, the Discriminator's weights are frozen, and the Discriminator's classification error is used to update the Generator's weights. The Generator's goal is to minimize the Discriminator's ability to differentiate between real and generated images.

This process is repeated for a specified number of epochs, with the Generator and Discriminator iteratively improving.

## Hyperparameters

The hyperparameters used in this project were carefully selected and optimized through experimentation. The chosen values proved to be the most effective for training this GAN and achieving satisfactory results in generating Fashion-MNIST images.
